# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories help organize and identify key functionalities within the customer’s wishes. It helps gauge the end user and it makes sure their expectations are the same as yours as you begin developing. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach developing programs incrementally. Agile teaches that everything can be prioritized and broken down into smaller tasks. This will help me not feel so overwhelmed in the beginning. An agile process that I hope to incorporate into my future development work would probably be daily scrum events. I find that communicating with development teams and gauging with one promotes a healthy work environment. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member within software development should promote patience, transparency, and dedication.
